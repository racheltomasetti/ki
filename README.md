# Ki

THE FUTURE IS NOW...
"and yet it may be that what we have is a world not on the verge of flying apart, but an uncreated one -- still in shapeless fragments waiting to be put together properly. I imagine that when we want something better, we may have it: at perhaps no greater price than we have already paid for worse" (KATHERINE ANNE PORTER).

DEDICATED TO LIFELONG DREAMERS AND DOERS.

## PREFACE

**Self**:
**Personal Legend**:

### What is KI?

KI is a toolkit built for the Self, designed to augment the journey of realizing one's dreams.

## PURPOSE

To unlock the magic within.

## ORIGIN STORY

As anything else, there is always a story leading up to the story. For the sake of this one, we will begin on MAY 28, 2023. It begins with a thought, or rather an intention: to become the best version of myself...

{INSERT ORIGIN STORY HERE}

... and that takes us to where we are now. To who I am and what I am building. My name is Rachel Tomasetti, but you can call RAY, and I AM BUILDING KI. Stemming from the continuous and ever-changing **pursuit of thriving**: to... - be one's most authentic Self - view life as an adventure - have autonomy over mind, body, and time - find balance & beauty in the little things - lead with boldness - treat all with compassion (Self included) - take on any challenge as an opportunity for growth - build connection & community - let creativity flow freely - be relentlessly determined - have steadfast faith in Self - live fully in the present - seek knowledge & learning always - **HAVE COURAGE & PURSUE THE DREAM.**

## HOW IT WORKS

1. Must first build foundation of **Self BELIEF | LOVE**, for "those who don't believe in magic will never find it"(ROALD DAHL).
